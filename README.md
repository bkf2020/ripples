An experimental tool using machine learning models (namely [UKPLabsentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers))
to try to determine **similar problems** from the **AMC 8/10/12 (American Mathematics Competitions)** and
**AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination)**. We use years 2010-2023 (some years are unavailable currently like 2023 AMC10/12).
We use [UKPLabsentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) to see similarities between problems and their solutions
to determine problems that are similar to each other.

This may help those practicing improve their **problem solving and critical thinking skills** by practicing **ideas** they have some difficulty
with **over multiple problems**. If you struggled with solving one problem, testing if you really understood the ideas from that problem/practicing
those ideas on NEW but similar problems can be really helpful.

Note that **ideas/patterns** seem to be more important in excelling problem solving than just memorizing formulas/theorems/algorithms.

# Technology used
* Clustering with [UKPLabsentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers). See `cluster_problems.py`
  and the [documentation on clustering for sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/clustering/README.html)
* Scraping with [Beautiful Soup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/). See `scraper.py`
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the website

# Current way of getting results
First we scrape all the problems with `scraper.py`. (Not going to upload the copyrighted problems in this github repo.)
```
pip install bs4 # install dependencies (may need to include more)
python scraper.py # this will create the problems in a folder called "problems" in the directory you ran the script. Also creates a log.txt file
```
Then we run `cluster_problems.py` to cluster the problems into the various groups. Generates a JSON file with the results.
We adjust `distance_threshold` in `cluster_problems.py` currently to try to get more accurate results.

# Improvements
Hopefully we can improve the results in the future together as a community. THat's why this is an open source project.
Currently, I'm seeing if we can finetune this model ([UKPLabsentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers))
to be better at seeing similarities in math problems/solutions.
